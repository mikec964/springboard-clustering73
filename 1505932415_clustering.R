# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'
# Go here for the original blog post and solutions
# http://www.r-bloggers.com/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already

# install.packages(c("cluster", "rattle.data","NbClust"))

# Now load the data and look at the first few rows
data(wine, package="rattle.data")
head(wine)

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function
#mac: this scales by standard deviations from mean
wine$Type <- NULL
wine <- scale(wine)
head(wine)

# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters. 

#mac: wss is within-groups sums of squares
wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234) {
  wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var)) # wss[1] for a single cluster
  for (i in 2:nc) {
    set.seed(seed)
    wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)
  }
  plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
       ylab="Within groups sum of squares")
}

wssplot(wine)

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest?
#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it?
#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works
#mac: It suggests 3 clusters, the wss reduction declines above 3
#mac: It works by first scaling all metrics to SD from mean
#mac: The function calculates wss for 1 to 15 kmeans clusters


# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

library(NbClust)
set.seed(1234)
nc <- NbClust(wine, min.nc=2, max.nc=15, method="kmeans")
barplot(table(nc$Best.n[1,]),
        xlab="Numer of Clusters", ylab="Number of Criteria",
        main="Number of Clusters Chosen by 26 Criteria")


# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?
#mac: The text suggests 3 clusters (proposed by 15 of 23),
#mac: The graph, when zoomed in, also suggests 3

# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

fit.km <- kmeans(wine, centers=3)

# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$clusters
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?

# reload wine data to get Type column we nuked before
data(wine, package="rattle.data")
table(wine$Type)
fit.km$cluster <- as.factor(fit.km$cluster)
table(fit.km$cluster)
#mac: predicted numbers are arbitrarily assigned, but are they close?
#mac: look at a confusion matrix
table(actual=wine$Type, predicted=fit.km$cluster)
#mac: yes, remarkably so, only about 6 mismatches

# Exercise 6:
# * Visualize these clusters using  function clusplot() from the cluster library
# * Would you consider this a good clustering?

library(cluster)
clusplot(wine, fit.km$cluster)
#mac: the grouping looks good to me!
#mac: there are just a few in the wrong group

#mac: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
wine_d <- scale(wine[-1]) # scale, remove column 1
wine_pc <- princomp(wine_d)
summary(wine_pc)
#mac: note component 1 and 2 predict 55.4% of point variability
cor(wine_d)
plot(wine_pc$scores[,"Comp.1"], wine_pc$scores[,"Comp.2"])
#mac: note similarity between plot with 2 components and actual!
